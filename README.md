## Why

I created this project to help maintaining some super-old Hugo sites. Sometimes I cannot change the development environment on behalf of other people/parties. Sometimes I want to quickly install the latest extended-Hugo that just works.

The project supports:

- Separated "normal" and **Sass/SCSS extended** versions for your projects/clients.
- Work from latest to legacy versions.

## Install

Check availability of these generic POSIX utilities:

```shell
which bash curl tar asdf
```

Add plugin:

```shell
asdf plugin add hugo https://github.com/Edditoria/asdf-hugo.git
```

Install Hugo:

```shell
# Show all installable versions
asdf list-all hugo

# Install specific version
asdf install 104.0.1
# or specific extended version with Sass/SCSS
asdf install extended-104.0.1

# Install latest version
asdf install hugo latest
# or latest extended version with Sass/SCSS
asdf install hugo latest:extended

# Set a version globally (on your ~/.tool-versions file)
asdf global hugo latest
# or extended version with Sass/SCSS
asdf global hugo latest:extended

# Now hugo commands are available
hugo version
```

Uninstall:

```shell
# Change the version that you want to uninstall
asdf uninstall hugo 104.0.1
asdf uninstall hugo extended-104.0.1
```
